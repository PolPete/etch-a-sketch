Etch-a-Sketch

This project is based from instructions within The Odin Project's curriculum.

Etch-a-Sketch incorporates the aesthetics of the 1950s toy and the functionality of a sketchpad. The user uses the mouse pointer to ink the display grid of the toy. With a button, the user can also reset the grid and use a custom grid of sizes up to 64x64.
